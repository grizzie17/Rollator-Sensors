# Rollator-Sensors #

Ultrasonic sensors for a Rollator (Walker).  The goal is to provide assistance for visually impared individuals that must use a walker and thus can not use a blind cane.

The first test unit will be married to a `Medline Empower Rollator Walker`.

## Overall Circuit ##

![Circuit](images/rollator-circuit.png)

The core of the system is an `Arduino nano` microprocessor.  No devices (sensors) are powered directly from the microprocessor with the exception of the ADXL345 accelerometer (which is powered from the microprocessor's 3.3V pin).

One of the main requirements is that there be no need for a user selectable power switch.  To accomplish this we must be very judicious with the power. We will powerdown or force devices to enter a sleep-mode.  We use an accelerometer to recognize motion (or lack thereof) and wake up or put the microprocessor to sleep as needed.  The microprocessor and the accelerometer are the only items that have continuous power (but both can be put to sleep), all other devices are powered via a 5V relay.  When the microprocessor sleeps the relay disconnects the power.

The microprocessor polls three ultrasonic sensors at an effective rate of 12hz (that is 4hz for each sensor multiplied by the number of sensors).  The three ultrasonic sensors are aranged with one forward facing sensor, and two side facing sensors (left and right).

To provide user feedback, there are two vibrators that will be placed, one in each handle bar.  No vibration indicates that no obstacles are near.  Vibration from both handles indicates that an obstacle is ahead of the Rollator.  An individual handle vibrating indicates obstacles on the corresponding side.

## Arduino nano ##

![Arduino Nano V3](images/arduino-nano-rev3.png)

The `Arduino Nano V3` microprocessor is the heart of our Rollator-sensor project.

Please see the tables in the sections below for connection details to the Arduino.

## Battery Pack ##

![18650 Batteries](images/18650_3000mAh.jpg)

The `Battery Pack` will be made from 18650 batteries.  Each pack is configured as 2S4P (2 Series and 4 Parallel).  Each battery cell is rated at 3000 mAh, providing an overall nominal rating, 7.4V 12000 mAh. The actual voltage range is from 8.30V to 5.60V.

![battery-pack-circuit](images/battery-pack-circuit.png)

The packs will use an EC3 connector (frequently used on R/C models), and a 3 wire balance connector which will allow the pack to be charged using a standard R/C balancing battery charger (that includes a Li-Ion setting).

## Voltage Regulator ##

![Regulator Pins](images/pololu-3.jpg)

| pin  | description                                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| VOUT | Output voltage; determined by the trimmer potentiometer |
| GND  | Ground                                                  |
| VIN  | Input voltage; should be between 3V-16V                 |
| EN   | Enable; used for setting cutoff voltage                 |
| PG   | Power Good                                              |

![Setting Output and Cutoff](images/pololu-2.jpg)

### Setting the output voltage ###

The output voltage of the regulator is controlled with a 12-turn precision potentiometer. Turning the potentiometer clockwise increases the output voltage, and it can be measured using a multimeter.

### Setting the cutoff voltage ###

The low VIN cutoff voltage of the regulator is controlled by adjusting the voltage at the EN pin with a 12-turn precision potentiometer. When the voltage on the EN pin falls below 0.7V the regulator is put in a low-power sleep state and when the voltage on EN rises back above 0.8V the regulator is turned back on. Turning the potentiometer clockwise increases the low-voltage cutoff. The cutoff voltage can be set by measuring the voltage on the VIN and EN pins and using the potentiometer to adjust the voltage on EN according to the following equation:

EN / 0.7V = VIN / VIN cutoff

EN = VIN * 0.7V / VIN cutoff

For example, if you connect VIN to a battery that currently measures 3.7V and you want to set the cutoff voltage to 3.0V, the equation becomes:

EN / 0.7V = 3.7V / 3.0V

Solving for EN yields approximately 0.86V, so you should turn the potentiometer until you measure that voltage on the EN pin.

Note that the regulatorâ€™s low VIN cutoff behavior includes hysteresis: the regulator turns off when EN falls below 0.7V, but it does not turn back on until EN rises above 0.8V. Therefore, VIN must reach about 114% of the cutoff voltage before the regulator will re-enable its output (about 3.43V in this example).

### So for our purposes ###

LiPo VIN cutoff should be 7.0V and the fully charged battery pack should be 8.4V.

EN = 8.4V * 0.7V / 7.0V  
EN = 0.87

Li-Ion VIN cutoff should be 5.6V and the fully charged battery pack should be 8.3V.

EN = 8.3V * 0.7V / 5.6V  
EN = 1.038

## ADXL345 Accelerometer ##

![ADXL345 Accelerometer](images/ADXL345-Accelerometer-Module.jpg)

The `Accelerometer` is used for two purposes in our system:

* provide a wakeup/sleep identifier based on motion of the walker.
* recognize that the walker has been layed down on either its back or its side and put the walker to sleep regardless of other motion.

We use the I2C connections using SDA and SCL.

The following table identifies the connections for the
ADXL345 to an Arduino Nano

| ADXL345 | Arduino          | Notes               |

## Relay ##

![Relay](images/HFD2-005-M-L2-D.jpg)

The relay is used to power-up the ultrasonic sensors and other devices (with the exception of the ADXL345) for when they are needed. Otherwise they are powered-down.

![Relay-Pins](images/Relay-pins.png)

> Please note that the pins identified above are not sequential.  They are using position on a breadboard (e.g., pins 3,5,7,10,12,14) are non-existant. In our case, we will not be using pins 6, 9-13.

The relay being used has been changed to the HFD2/005-M-L2-D which is a double poll double throw relay.  The important part of this relay is that it does not require power to maintain set/reset condition.  There are two pins that control the unit; one for `set` (on) and the other for `reset` (off).  Setting the appropriate pin to +5V for 5 milliseconds will change the relay setting.

| Relay | Arduino | Circuit         |
| ----- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1     | D3      | (reset)         |
| 2     | D4      | (set)           |
| 4     |         | VCC (from Reg.) |
| 8     |         | OUT +5V         |
| 16,15 | GND     | GND             |

## HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors ##

There are three HC-SR04 sensors.  One facing forward,
one facing left, one facing right.

| HC-SR04 | Arduino | Notes          |
| ------- | ------- | -------------- |
| VCC     | -       | Relay VOUT     |
| Trigger | D7,8,9  | Echo connected |
| Echo    | Trigger |                |
| GND     | GND     |                |

Using the `YogiSonic` library allows us to connect the `trigger` and `echo` pins so we save pins on the Arduino.
