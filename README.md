![Setting Output and Cutoff](images/pololu-2.jpg)

### Setting the output voltage ###

The output voltage of the regulator is controlled with a 12-turn precision potentiometer. Turning the potentiometer clockwise increases the output voltage, and it can be measured using a multimeter.

### Setting the cutoff voltage ###

The low VIN cutoff voltage of the regulator is controlled by adjusting the voltage at the EN pin with a 12-turn precision potentiometer. When the voltage on the EN pin falls below 0.7 V the regulator is put in a low-power sleep state and when the voltage on EN rises back above 0.8 V the regulator is turned back on. Turning the potentiometer clockwise increases the low-voltage cutoff. The cutoff voltage can be set by measuring the voltage on the VIN and EN pins and using the potentiometer to adjust the voltage on EN according to the following equation:

EN / 0.7V = VIN / VIN cutoff

EN = VIN * 0.7V / VIN cutoff

For example, if you connect VIN to a battery that currently measures 3.7 V and you want to set the cutoff voltage to 3.0 V, the equation becomes:

EN / 0.7V = 3.7V / 3.0V

Solving for EN yields approximately 0.86 V, so you should turn the potentiometer until you measure that voltage on the EN pin.

Note that the regulatorâ€™s low VIN cutoff behavior includes hysteresis: the regulator turns off when EN falls below 0.7 V, but it does not turn back on until EN rises above 0.8 V. Therefore, VIN must reach about 114% of the cutoff voltage before the regulator will re-enable its output (about 3.43 V in this example).

### So for our purposes ###

LiPo VIN cutoff should be 7.0V and the fully charged battery pack should be 8.4V.

EN = 8.4V * 0.7V / 7.0V  
EN = 0.87

Li-Ion VIN cutoff should be 5.6V and the fully charged battery pack should be 8.4V.

EN = 8.4V * 0.7V / 5.6V  
EN = 1.05

## HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor ##

There are four HC-SR04 sensors.  Two facing forward,
one facing left, one facing right.

| HC-SR04 | Arduino    | Notes          |
| ------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Vcc     | 5v         |                |
| Trigger | D5,7,10,12 | Echo connected |
| Echo    | Trigger    |                |
| GND     | GND        |                |

Using the `YogiSonic` library allows us to connect the `trigger` and `echo` pins so we save 
pins on the Arduino.

## Relay ##

The relay is used to powerdown most of the sensors and other devices while the micro-controller is sleeping.

![Relay Circuit](images/Arduino-Relay.jpg)

1k resistor between NPN transistor `base` pin and signal pin on the micro-controller.

1N4007 diode to protect the micro-controller from voltage spikes.

|  87.0 | Battery to Pololu (Active) |
|   2.5 | Battery to Pololu (Sleep)  |
|   3.6 | Pololu to Main ?????       |

Question: Why is the "Pololu to Main" more than the "Battery to Pololu"?
